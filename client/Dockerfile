# Filename: Dockerfile
# Purpose:  File to test whether the database initialization script is working
#           as expected
# Author:   Benjamin Goh
#
# Description:
# This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for a Node.js application
# that tests the initialization of a database. It sets up the environment,
# installs dependencies, and runs the application.
#
# Usage:
# To build the Docker image, run the following command in the directory
# containing this Dockerfile:
#   docker build -t <image-name> .
#
# To run the Docker container, use:
#   docker run -p 3000:3000 <image-name>
#
# Notes:
# Ensure that the 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' (if available) are
# present in the same directory as this Dockerfile and contain all the necessary
# Node.js packages. The application is expected to be exposed on port 3000.
