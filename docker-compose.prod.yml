# Filename: docker-compose.prod.yml
# Purpose : Define and manage the production environment for the application
# Author  : Benjamin Goh

# Description:
# This Docker Compose file orchestrates the production environment for the application,
# configuring services such as Nginx, frontend, backend, and the database to work
# together optimally. This setup is intended for live deployment, ensuring that
# all components are tuned for production settings.

# Usage:
# To deploy the application in a production environment, execute the following command
# in the directory containing this file:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
#
# This command builds the images if necessary, starts up the services, and runs them
# in the background.

# Notes:
# - Ensure that all environment variables, such as `NODE_ENV` and `DATABASE_URL`, are
#   configured to reflect your production settings.
# - The `nginx` service is configured to listen on port 8765 and serves as the reverse
#   proxy for frontend and backend services.
# - Persistent storage is managed for the database service with a Docker volume, which
#   ensures data persistence across container restarts.
# - It is recommended to secure your database and other services with proper network
#   restrictions and security settings in production.
# - Regular backups and monitoring are advisable for production environments to ensure
#   data integrity and service availability.
