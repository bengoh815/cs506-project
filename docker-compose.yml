# Filename: docker-compose.yml
# Purpose : Define the orchestration of services for the web application
# Author  : Benjamin Goh

# Description:
# This Docker Compose file orchestrates a web application setup that includes
# an Nginx reverse proxy, frontend, backend, and a database service. It specifies
# the build context, dependencies, and configurations necessary for each service
# to function correctly in a unified environment.

# Usage:
# To start the services, ensure Docker is installed and run the following command
# in the directory containing this file:
#   docker-compose up --build
#
# This will build the images if they don't exist and start the services. The Nginx
# service is set up to listen on port 8765, routing traffic to the frontend and
# backend services as configured.

# Notes:
# - Ensure that the Dockerfile exists in each service directory specified in the
#   build paths (./nginx, ./client, ./server, ./database).
# - The 'db' service uses environment variables to configure the MySQL database.
# - Persistent volume 'db_data' is used to maintain database data across container
#   restarts.
# - The services are linked with 'depends_on', ensuring that they start in the
#   correct order. However, this does not wait for a service to be "ready" before
#   starting the next one, which should be managed internally in the services.
